#" First outer loop is used to handle number of rows and Inner nested loop is used to handle the number of columns"
#nested loop is used for pattern printing also
#Iteration is a general term for taking each item of something, one after another. Any time you use a loop, explicit or implicit, to go over a group of items, that is iteration. 



# for i in range(4):

#     for j in range(4):
#         print(i,j)

#DOUBTS
# enumerate() function allows us    to loop over an iterable object and keep track of how many iterations have occurred.

"""enumerate Function
Iterate over a list with value manipulation using map and lambda, i.e. apply lambda function on each element in the
list:
x = map(lambda e : e.upper(), ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'])
print(x)
Output:
['ONE', 'TWO', 'THREE', 'FOUR'] # Python 2.x


while loop
